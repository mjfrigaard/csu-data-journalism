# Objectives

This lesson covers some basic exposure to R functions and data objects. 

# Materials 

The slides for this section are available [here](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/intro-to-r-programming/Index.html#1).

# R Syntax 

Two major elements in R programming: functions and objects.

## Functions & Objects 

+ **Functions** perform operations (calculate a mean, build a table, create a graph, etc.)

+ **Objects** hold information (a collection of numbers, dates, words, models results, etc.)

# Vectors 

Vectors are the fundamental data type in R. Most R functions are 'vectorized', meaning they're optimized to work on vectors. 

## Atomic vectors {.tabset}

The "atomic" in atomic vectors means, "*of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.*"

### Logical 

Logical vectors are handy because when we add them together, and the total number tells us how many `TRUE` values there are.

```{r vec_logical}
vec_logical <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
vec_logical
```

### Integer 

Integer vectors are created with a number and capital letter `L`

```{r vec_integer}
vec_integer <- c(1L, 10L, 100L)
vec_integer
```

### Double 

Double vectors can be entered as decimals

```{r vec_double}
vec_double <- c(0.1, 1.0, 10.01)
vec_double
```

### Character

Note that character vectors need to be in quotes.

```{r vec_character}
vec_character <- c("A", "B", "C")
vec_character
```

## Evaluating vectors {.tabset}

**Store and explore** - create an object, perform an operation on the object, store the results, then explore the contents with another function.

```{r store-explore, echo=FALSE, out.height='60%', out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/store-explore.png")
```

### `typeof()` 

Explore all vectors with `typeof()`

```{r typeof-vec_integer}
typeof(vec_integer)
```

### `is.integer()`

Integers have no decimals.

```{r is.integer}
is.integer(vec_integer)
```


### `is.numeric()`

Evaluate numeric vectors with `is.numeric()`

```{r is-numeric-vec_double}
is.numeric(vec_double)
```

### `is.logical()`

`is.logical()` to check vectors that are logical.

```{r is.logical}
is.logical(vec_logical)
```

Recall that you can sum logical vectors. 

```{r sum-logical-vectors}
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE + TRUE
```

Great for subsetting too.

```{r subsetting-with-loigcals}
vec_integer > 5
```

### `is.character()`

Check character vectors with `is.character()`

```{r is.character}
is.character(vec_character)
```

## Vectorized {.tabset}

R is often referred to as a "vector-oriented", "vectorized", or "element-wise" language because of the way it deals with vectors. We will show an example of this behavior below: 

### Create sequence of values 

THe code below creates a sequence of ten values between `1.5` and `10.5`.

```{r vec_seq_01}
vec_seq_01 <- 1.5:10.5
length(vec_seq_01)
vec_seq_01
```

### Vector operation by position 

Now we create `vec_seq_02`, which has a sequence of ten values between `0.2` and `2.0`.

```{r vec_seq_02}
vec_seq_02 <- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,
                1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0)
vec_seq_02
```

Now we subtract `vec_seq_02` from `vec_seq_01`:

```{r vec_seq_01-vec_seq_02}
vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_02
```

The result is a vector that's the subtraction of the first element of `vec_seq_02` from the first element of `vec_seq_01`, and so on...

```{r vectorized}
vec_seq_01[1] - vec_seq_02[1] 
vec_seq_01[2] - vec_seq_02[2] 
vec_seq_01[3] - vec_seq_02[3] 
```

### unequal lengths

Both `vec_seq_01` and `vec_seq_02` have equal lengths. What happens when we apply vectorized operations to objects of unequal length? Well, R attempts to recycle the operations. We will demonstrate this by creating `vec_seq_03`, which only has three numbers in it:

```{r vec_seq_03}
vec_seq_03 <- vec_seq_02[1:3]
vec_seq_03
```

When we try to subtract `vec_seq_03` from `vec_seq_01` we get the following error:

```{r unequal-length}
vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_03
```

This is telling us R attempted to subtract each element by position, but ran out of numbers. 

That's why the first three numbers of `vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_03` look identical to `vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_02`:

```{r compare-subtraction-1}
# compare first three elements
vec_seq_01[1:3] - vec_seq_02[1:3]
# compare first three elements
vec_seq_01[1:3] - vec_seq_03[1:3]
```

But when R goes looking elements at position `vec_seq_03[4]`, it finds nothing (`NA`):

```{r nothing-in-vec_seq_03}
vec_seq_03[4]
```

So it recycles at the beginning of the vector again. Look at the code below to see how this behavior creates the values in `vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_03`.

```{r recycle-vectors}
vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_03
vec_seq_01[1:3] - vec_seq_03[1:3]
vec_seq_01[4:6] - vec_seq_03[1:3]
vec_seq_01[7:9] - vec_seq_03[1:3]
```

Where does the `10.3` come from? That is what's left over (and why we get the error message).

```{r left-over-value}
vec_seq_01[10] - vec_seq_03[1]
```

If `vec_seq_01` had a length that was a multiple of `vec_seq_03`, R would've still performed recycling (but without an error message).

```{r unequal-length-multiple}
vec_seq_04 <- vec_seq_02[1:5]
vec_seq_01 - vec_seq_04
```



## S3 vectors {.tabset}

S3 vector objects are factors, dates, date-times, durations.

### Factors 

Factors are categorical vectors with a given set of responses.

```{r vec_factor}
vec_factor <- factor(x = c("low", "medium", "high"))
vec_factor
# Not character variables!
typeof(vec_factor)
```

We can manually assign the order of factor levels with the `levels` argument in `factor()`.

```{r factor-levels}
vec_factor <- factor(x = c("medium", "high", "low"), 
                     levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
# check with:
levels(vec_factor)
unclass(vec_factor)
```

### Dates 

Dates are stored as `double` vectors with a class attribute set to `Date`.

```{r vec_date}
vec_date <- c(Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 1, Sys.Date() + 2)
vec_date
attributes(vec_date)
```

`unclass()` tells us what the actual number is.

```{r unclass-vec_date}
unclass(vec_date)
```

### Date-times 

Date-times contain a bit more information than dates.

```{r vec_datetime_ct}
vec_datetime_ct <- as.POSIXct(x = vec_date)
vec_datetime_ct
```

`vec_datetime_ct` is a `double` vector 

```{r typeof-vec_datetime_ct}
typeof(vec_datetime_ct)
```


### Durations (difftime)

We need two times to be able to calculate the difftime, but the output is fairly clear. 

```{r vec_difftime}
time_01 <- Sys.Date()
time_02 <- Sys.Date() + 10
vec_difftime <- difftime(time_01, time_02, units = "days")
vec_difftime
```

These have `class` and `units` attributes. 

```{r attributes-vec_difftime}
attributes(vec_difftime)
```

# Multidimensional objects

In the next sections we'll cover matrices and arrays, two of R's multidimensional objects.

## Matrices {.tabset}

These are two-dimensional objects. We can create with `matrix()`. 

### Create matrices

We can make a matrix using our existing vectors.

```{r mat_data}
mat_data <- matrix(data = c(vec_double, vec_integer), 
                   nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
mat_data
```

### Check dimensions 

We can check the dimensions of `mat_data` with `dim()`.

```{r dim-mat_data}
dim(mat_data)
```


### Matrix positions 

We can subset using position. 

```{r mat_data-positions}
mat_data[2, 2]
```


## Arrays {.subset}

Arrays are like matrices, but with more dimensions.

```{r array-png, out.height='45%', out.width='45%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/array.png")
```


### Create an array

Arrays need three dimensions in the `dim` argument.

```{r dat_array}
dat_array <- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                            14, 15, 16, 17, 18), dim = c(3, 3, 2))
dat_array
```

### Matrix vs. Array

Matrices are arrays, but arrays are not matrices.

```{r class-dat_array}
class(dat_array)
```

```{r class-mat_data}
class(mat_data)
```

# Rectangular data in R

If you're importing spreadsheets, most of the work you'll do in R will be with rectangular data objects (i.e. `data.frame`s and `tibble`s).

```{r data-frame-tibble, echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', out.height='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/data-frame-tibble.png")
```

## Data Frames {.tabset}

Rectangular data with rows and columns. 

### Create data frames 

We will create a data frame below using `data.frame()`. When we create a data frame, the data are transposed (i.e. columns are written left-to-right).

```{r DataFrame}
DataFrame <- data.frame(character = c("A", "B", "C"), 
                        integer = c(0.1, 1.0, 10.01), 
                        logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
DataFrame
```

*NOTE: `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` is not required as of R version 4.0.0.*

### Inspect `data.frame`s

Check the structure of the data.frame with `str()`

```{r str-DataFrame}
str(DataFrame)
```

## Tibbles {.tabset}

These are special kinds of `data.frame`s (they print better to the console, and character vectors are never coerced into factors).

### Create `tibble`s  

Creating `tibble`s is *not* transposed. 

```{r Tibble}
Tibble <- tibble::tribble(
       ~character, ~integer,  ~logical,
              "A",      0.1,      TRUE,
              "B",        1,     FALSE,
              "C",    10.01,      TRUE)
Tibble
```


### Inspect `tibble`s

`tibbles` are S3 objects, with types `tbl_df`, `tbl`, *and* `data.frame`

```{r str-tibble}
str(Tibble)
```

# The 'catch-all' 

Lists are unique objects in R because they are *recursive vectors*. We've pointed out that atomic vectors can't be broken down into smaller components, but a list can store objects of multiple types (character, numeric, logical, etc.), `data.frame`s, `tibble`s, and even other lists. 

## Lists {.tabset}

Unlike `data.frame`s, `tibble`s (which require each vector to be of equal length), lists can store objects of different types *and* sizes.

### Create lists 

We can put all the objects we've created in `dat_list`.

```{r dat_list}
dat_list <- list("integer" = vec_integer, 
                 "array" = dat_array,
                 "matrix data" = mat_data,
                 "data frame" = DataFrame, 
                 "tibble" = Tibble)
dat_list
```


### List attributes 

And we can see all of these elements are stored (with the appropriate name).

```{r attributes-dat_list}
attributes(dat_list)
```

Think of `data.frame`s and `tibble`s as special kinds of rectangular `lists`, made with different types of vectors, with each vector being of equal length.
